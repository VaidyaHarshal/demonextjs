## Architecture Decisions

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React with Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **State Management**: React's built-in state management.

### Key Decisions

1. **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities and built-in routing support.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Selected for its flexibility and ease of creating responsive designs.

### Code Structure

- **`pages/`**: Contains the Next.js pages and routing logic.
- **`components/`**: Houses reusable React components.
- **`public/`**: Static assets like images and fonts.
- **`styles/`**: Global CSS and Tailwind configuration.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **State Management**

**Challenge**: Managing global state across various components can become complex, especially in large applications.

**Solution**: Use Reactâ€™s Context API for managing global state.

### 2. **API Integration**

**Challenge**: Integrating and managing API calls can be error-prone, especially with complex or dynamic APIs.

**Solution**: Use libraries like Fetch with proper error handling and request cancellation.
